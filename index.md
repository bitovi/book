# Welcome to the Book of Bitovi!

Here you'll learn, or be pointed to, practically everything you need to 
know to build a JavaScript application. This is not intended to be an
API reference as you can find those elsewhere.  Instead, this is designed
to give you a general understanding so that any gaps can be immediately filled.

## JavaScript

Mastering JavaScript is the first step in building a JavaScript application. Unfortunately, many think 
that libraries like 
jQuery, Backbone, or even CanJS are short-cuts around fully understanding JavaScript.  They aren't.

Fortunately, JavaScript is one of the easist languages to conceptually understand.  It's designed to be 
simple to implement. You just have to throw out everything you know about most other languages.

So, the first step in understanding JavaScript is to understand it's place in the universe ... that is
it's place in the Browser.
