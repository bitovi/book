# Welcome to the Book of Bitovi!

Here you'll learn, or be pointed to, practically everything you need to 
know to build a modern JavaScript application. This is not an
API reference. You can find those elsewhere.  Instead, this is designed
to give you a general understanding so that any gaps can be immediately filled.

By __JavaScript application__ we mean an app where JavaScript is building most of the 
app's HTML and is communicating with the server via AJAX services.

## JavaScript

Mastering JavaScript is the first step in building a JavaScript application. Unfortunately, many think 
that libraries like 
jQuery, Backbone, or even CanJS are short-cuts around fully understanding JavaScript.  They aren't.

Fortunately, JavaScript is one of most simple languages understand because it's designed to be easy to 
implement.
You just have to throw 
out everything you know about most other languages.

So, the first step in understanding JavaScript is to understand it's place in the universe ... that is
it's place in the Browser.
